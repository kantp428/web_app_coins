# UI prototype decisions

- User request on 2026-10-06 authorizes a mobile wallet UI for normal/customer and store/seller across apps/web, covering D1-A/F04 and D1-B/F05 shells with F09/F10 preview screens. No API integration, authentication, payment, or government role in this task.
- All balances, sales, Coins, eligibility, map pins, AI replies, and approval statuses are explicitly illustrative fixtures. They do not establish business rules. Store form changes are local and reset on reload.
- Use shadcn default neutral tokens. Customer and seller routes reuse a mobile shell; role links are preview navigation, not access control.
- Unresolved payment, benefit, location, and Coins rules remain deferred to the API contract before integration. No financial or Coins state is recalculated or persisted by this prototype.
