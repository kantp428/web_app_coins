# UI prototype decisions

- User request on 2026-10-06 authorizes a mobile wallet UI for normal/customer and store/seller across apps/web, covering D1-A/F04 and D1-B/F05 shells with F09/F10 preview screens. No API integration, authentication, payment, or government role in this task.
- All balances, sales, Coins, eligibility, map pins, AI replies, and approval statuses are explicitly illustrative fixtures. They do not establish business rules. Store form changes are local and reset on reload.
- Use shadcn default neutral tokens. Customer and seller routes reuse a mobile shell; role links are preview navigation, not access control.
- Unresolved payment, benefit, location, and Coins rules remain deferred to the API contract before integration. No financial or Coins state is recalculated or persisted by this prototype.

- Prisma schema validation fix (2026-10-06): keep one coin entry per purchase and its composite ownership/rule relation; add explicit composite unique metadata required by Prisma. This additional constraint is not applied to the existing DB by this edit and must be reconciled in a reviewed migration. Reward grants have multiple money entries; the partial unique for REWARD_ALLOCATION remains unchanged. No DB mutation was executed.

- Existing Neon database baselined as 0_init on 2026-10-06. Baseline preserves the live generated subsidy column, 55 check constraints and four reporting views. Executed all baseline SQL in an isolated schema within a transaction and rolled it back; schema-to-datasource diff was empty. Marked 0_init applied through Prisma resolve; application tables/data were not reset or migrated. Future schema changes require new migrations, not edits to 0_init.
